# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

Given some starter code, I have built a text editor that runs in the browser. This application meets PWA criteria, so is able to be installed to the desktop.

The text editor uses code editor stylings for any code written within it.

You can download the app by pressing the install button

or clicking the icon in the address bar if your browser supports PWAs.

The application uses IndexedDB as a form of data persistence, and a service worker to cache data so what you have written within the app is available if you download the app or are offline.
